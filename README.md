# Static type information for the construct library

This is an attempt to provide type information for the [Construct](https://construct.readthedocs.io/) Python parsing library.

This is a set of [typing stubs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stubs.html) for Construct that enable type checking using `mypy` or similar when using the Construct library.

To use it, clone/download this repo and add the path to it to your `mypy_path` configuration variable.
